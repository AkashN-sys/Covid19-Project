This project leverages the comprehensive COVID-19 dataset, employing a combination of SQL and Tableau for a thorough analysis of the pandemic's effects. 
The analysis aims to shed light on critical aspects, including identifying regions with the highest and lowest mortality rates, discerning early adopters of vaccination campaigns, and evaluating vaccination rates across various locations.
Additionally, the project delves into the percentage of affected populations, assesses mortality rates, and provides valuable insights into the overall healthcare infrastructure, regional preparedness, and the general health of communities. 
Through this multifaceted approach, the project offers a comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's impact on different regions.
